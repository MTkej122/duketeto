# Debian + Wine + OpenVNC + Docker Compose + Okteto = awesome

[![Develop on Okteto](https://okteto.com/develop-okteto.svg)](https://cloud.okteto.com/deploy)

Inspired by https://twitter.com/lach_dev/status/1385300108883943427, this show cases a few of Okteto's features:
- Deploy with one click (click the big green button!)
- Build containers on demand
- Compatibility with Docker-Compose
- Automatic SSL endpoint and a proxy

I'm not an expert on Wine, so the resolution is not ideal. But accepting PRs :)
