# Debian + Wine + VNC + Docker Compose + Okteto = awesome

[![Develop on Okteto](https://okteto.com/develop-okteto.svg)](https://cloud.okteto.com/deploy)

Inspired by [≈Åukasz Lach's tweet](https://twitter.com/lach_dev/status/1385300108883943427), this showcases a few of Okteto's features:
- Deploy with one click (click the big green button!)
- Build containers on demand
- Compatibility with Docker-Compose
- Automatic SSL endpoints
- Access behind login screen

I'm not an expert on Wine (the emulator, that is), so the resolution is off. But PRs accepted ;).

Thanks to Patrick Gaskin for [his guide on Containers + TigerVNC](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-remotely-access-gui-applications-using-docker-and-caddy-on-debian-9).
